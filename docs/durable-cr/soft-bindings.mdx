title: Watermarking and fingerprinting algorithms
hide_table_of_contents: true
---

The C2PA specification refers to watermarking and content fingerprinting as [soft bindings](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_soft_bindings), which can be used to find digital content, even if the underlying bits differ. The C2PA specification requires that soft bindings be generated using one of the [algorithms](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_soft_binding_algorithm_list) approved by the C2PA Technical Working Group.
