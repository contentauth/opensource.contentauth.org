The JavaScript SDK includes a number of selector functions as a convenient way to derive useful data from returned manifest objects. For instance, finding information on the producer of an asset requires locating the `stds.schema-org.CreativeWork` assertion and having familiarity with its strucutre:

```typescript
function selectProducer(manifest) {
  const cwAssertion = manifest.assertions.get('stds.schema-org.CreativeWork');
  return assertion.author?.find((x) => !x.hasOwnProperty('@id'));
}
```

However, the SDK provides [selectors](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js/tree/main/packages/c2pa/src/selectors) that simplify this code to:

<!-- Link to API doc https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/js-sdk/api/c2pa.resolvers.defaultresolvers instead? -->

```typescript
import { selectProducer } from 'c2pa';

const producer = selectProducer(manifest);
```

Some selectors may involve more complex, possibly asynchronous operations. `selectEditsAndActivity` abstracts a complex operation involving multiple manifest assertions and remote resources to return a formatted list of edits and activity described within a manifest:

```
import { selectEditsAndActivity } from 'c2pa';

const editsAndActivity = await selectEditsAndActivity(manifest);
