[Selector functions]([selector](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js/tree/main/packages/c2pa/src/selectors) provide a convenient way to derive useful data from returned manifest objects. The selector functions available are:

- `editsAndActivity` - Returns a formatted list of manifest edits and activity.
- `selectProducer - Returns information on the producer of an asset.
- `selectSocialAccounts` - Returns social accounts associated with the producer of a manifest, if available.

For instance, without using a selector, finding information on the producer of an asset requires locating the `stds.schema-org.CreativeWork` assertion and having familiarity with its strucutre:

```typescript
function selectProducer(manifest) {
  const cwAssertion = manifest.assertions.get('stds.schema-org.CreativeWork');
  return assertion.author?.find((x) => !x.hasOwnProperty('@id'));
}
```

Using the [`selectProducer`](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js/blob/main/packages/c2pa/src/selectors/selectProducer.ts) selector function simplifies this code to:

```typescript
import { selectProducer } from 'c2pa';

const producer = selectProducer(manifest);
```

Some selectors may involve complex, possibly asynchronous operations. For example, `selectEditsAndActivity` abstracts a complex operation involving multiple manifest assertions and remote resources to return a formatted list of edits and activity described within a manifest:

```typescript
import { selectEditsAndActivity } from 'c2pa';

const editsAndActivity = await selectEditsAndActivity(manifest);
```

The result is an `editsAndActivity` object such as this:

```

  {
    id: 'COLOR_ADJUSTMENTS',

    label: 'Color adjustments',
    description: 'Changed tone, saturation, etc.'
  },
  {
    id: 'IMPORT',
    icon: 'https://cai-assertions.adobe.com/icons/import-dark.svg',
    label: 'Imported assets',
    description: 'Added images, videos, etc.'
  },
  {
    id: 'TRANSFORM',
    icon: 'https://cai-assertions.adobe.com/icons/group-dark.svg',
    label: 'Size and position adjustments',
    description: 'Changed size, orientation, direction, or position'
  }
]
```
