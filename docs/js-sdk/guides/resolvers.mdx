The JavaScript SDK uses resolvers as a convenient way to return meaningful data from the parsed manifest store. For instance, finding information on who produced an asset requires locating and processing the `stds.schema-org.CreativeWork` assertion and having familiarity with its data structure:

```typescript
function getProducer(manifest) {
  const cwAssertion = manifest.assertions.get('stds.schema-org.CreativeWork');
  return assertion.author?.find((x) => !x.hasOwnProperty('@id'));
}
```

However, the SDK provides [default resolvers](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js/blob/main/packages/c2pa/src/resolvers/defaults.ts) that simplify this code to:

<!-- Link to API doc https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/js-sdk/api/c2pa.resolvers.defaultresolvers instead? -->

```typescript
function getProducer(manifest) {
  return manifest.producer;
}
```

This allows you to:

- Access common assertion data without having familiarity details of the spec/assertions.
- Combine data from different assertions to access a related set of information.
- Publish custom sets of resolvers to third parties that provide intuitive accessors into their custom assertions.
- Run asynchronous transformations on assertion data before accessing it.
