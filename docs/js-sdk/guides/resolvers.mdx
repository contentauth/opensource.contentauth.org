Resolvers are used by the `c2pa` library as a convenient way to return meaningful data from the parsed manifest store. For instance, finding info on who produced an asset involves locating and processing the `stds.schema-org.CreativeWork` assertion and having familiarity with its data structure:

```typescript
function getProducer(manifest) {
  const cwAssertion = manifest.assertions.get('stds.schema-org.CreativeWork');
  return assertion.author?.find((x) => !x.hasOwnProperty('@id'));
}
```

However, the [default resolvers](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js/blob/main/packages/c2pa/src/resolvers/defaults.ts) that are provided by the SDK allow us to simplify this to:

```typescript
function getProducer(manifest) {
  return manifest.producer;
}
```

This allows implementers to:

- Access common assertion data without having familiarity details of the spec/assertions
- Combine data from different assertions to access a related set of information
- Publish custom sets of resolvers to third parties that provide intuitive accessors into their custom assertions
- Run async transformations on assertion data before accessing it
