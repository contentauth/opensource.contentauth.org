## Validation

Part of processing a C2PA asset involves [validating the manifests](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_validation) that it contains. Any validation errors that occur in one of two places:

### Validation errors in the active manifest

When C2PA assets are loaded via [c2pa.read](../api/c2pa.c2pa#methods), the current manifest is validated and any [failure codes](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_failure_codes) codes are available via the `manifestStore.validationStatus` array. Some examples of events that could trigger errors in this field are:

- editing the bits of an asset after it was signed
- a claim or assertion was missing or tampered with
- an invalid credential was used when signing the manifest

### Validation errors in ingredients

[Ingredients](../../introduction#ingredient) are validated at the time they are imported into an asset. The results of this are stored in the manifest in the ingredient's [`validationStatus`](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_existing_manifests) object, which contains both [success](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_success_codes) and [failure](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_failure_codes) codes that represent the results of all of the validation checks that took place.

In the JavaScript SDK, you can access validation errors in ingredients like so:

```typescript
manifest.ingredients.forEach((ingredient) => {
  console.log('validationStatus', data.ingredient.validationStatus);
});
```

:::note
The `validationStatus` array provided by the SDK only reports failure `validationStatus` codes, as success codes are generally informational and do not affect the UI.

## Errors

Errors can also occur when trying to process the asset, which will throw a JavaScript error when calling [c2pa.read](../api/c2pa.c2pa#methods). You can capture these errors by always surrounding `c2pa.read` in a `try...catch` block:

```typescript
try {
  const { manifestStore } = await c2pa.read(sampleImage);
  console.log('manifestStore', manifestStore);
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Error reading image:', err);
}
```

Errors will have a name that corresponds with an [`c2pa::Error` enum variant](https://docs.rs/c2pa/latest/c2pa/enum.Error.html), surrounded with `C2pa()`, for instance `C2pa(UnsupportedType)`.

Examples of events that can cause an error to be thrown are:

- Passing in an asset that is not a supported file type (e.g. `image/jpeg`, `image/png`)
- Passing in an asset containing corrupted data
