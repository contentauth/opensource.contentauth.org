## Validation

Part of processing a C2PA asset involves [validating the manifests](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_validation) that it contains. Any validation errors that occur in one of two places:

### Validation errors in the active manifest

When C2PA assets are loaded via [c2pa.read](../api/c2pa.c2pa#methods), the current manifest is validated and any [failure codes](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_failure_codes) codes are available via the `manifest.errors` array. Some examples of events that could trigger errors in this field are:

- editing the bits of an asset after it was signed
- if an image was edited

### Validation errors in ingredients

[Ingredients](../../introduction#ingredient) are validated at the time they are imported into an asset. The results of this are stored in the manifest in the ingredient's [`validationStatus`](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_existing_manifests) object, which contains both [success](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_success_codes) and [failure](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_failure_codes) codes that represent the results of all of the validation checks that took place.

In the JavaScript SDK, you can access validation errors in ingredients like so:

```typescript
manifest.ingredients.forEach((ingredient) => {
  console.log('validationStatus', data.ingredient.validationStatus);
});
```

:::note
The `validationStatus` array provided by the SDK only reports failure `validationStatus` codes, as success codes are generally informational and do not affect the UI.
