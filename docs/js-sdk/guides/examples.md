title: JavaScript examples

JavaScript examples in [contentauth/c2pa-js-examples](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js-examples) are mirrored from the [examples directory in the contentauth/c2pa-js repository](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js/tree/main/examples).

The JavaScript library is intended for experienced JavaScript developers. It uses a number of modern JavaScript technologies such as WebAssembly (Wasm) and Web Workers; for the full list, see [Browser support](../getting-started/overview/#browser-support). 

Additionally, the JavaScript examples use TypeScript for type safety. You should be familiar with these technologies, as well as a popular module bundler tool such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), or [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
