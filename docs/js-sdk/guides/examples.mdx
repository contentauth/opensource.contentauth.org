JavaScript examples are in **[contentauth/c2pa-js-examples](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js-examples)**. The examples are mirrored from the [examples directory in the contentauth/c2pa-js repository](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js/tree/main/examples).

:::note
As noted in the [overview](../getting-started/overview#technologies-that-the-library-uses), the JavaScript library uses a number of modern JavaScript technologies such as WebAssembly (Wasm) and Web Workers. To understand the JavaScript examples, you should be familiar with these technologies, [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and at least one bundler tool such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), or [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
:::

Additionally, the JavaScript examples use TypeScript for type safety. |
