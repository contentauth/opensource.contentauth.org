## Initializing the library

The way that you import `wasmSrc` and `workerSrc` varies depending on the build system you use. For more information, see [Quick start](../getting-started/quick-start.mdx#bringing-in-the-javascript-library).

## Viewing manifest data

If the input provided to `c2pa.read` has a C2PA manifest and was processed without errors, the returned `c2paReadResult` contains a `manifestStore`.

The `manifestStore` object contains a few properties:

- **manifests**: An object containing _all_ manifests found in an asset, keyed by UUID.
- **activeManifest**: A pointer to the latest `manifest` in the manifest store. Effectively the "parent" manifest, this is the likely starting point when inspecting an asset's C2PA data.
- **validationStatus**: A list of any validation errors the library generated when processing an asset. See [Validation](./validation.mdx) for more information.

`Manifest` objects contain properties pertaining to an asset's provenance, along with convenient interfaces for accessing assertion data and generating a thumbnail.
