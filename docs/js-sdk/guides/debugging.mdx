title: Debugging
---

The JavaScript SDK uses the [debug](https://github.com/debug-js/debug) library to get debug-level information under the
`c2pa` namespace. To view debug messages in the console, use your browser's inspector, go to the Console
tab, and enter:

```js
localStorage.debug = 'c2pa:*';
```

The debuging information includes millisecond timing differences so you can get an idea of how long different events take.

:::note
Debug calls and statements are stripped out of minified production builds to reduce file size.

To turn off debugging, enter:

```js
localStorage.debug = false;
```
