title: Debugging

We use the [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) library to get debug-level information about the SDK, under the
`c2pa` namespace. To view debug messages in the console, you can load your browser's inspector, go to the Console
tab, and enter:

```js
localStorage.debug = 'c2pa:*';
```

This also includes millisecond timing diffs so you can get an idea of how long different events are taking.

:::note
Debug calls and statements are stripped out of minified production builds to reduce file size.

To turn off debugging, you can enter:

```js
localStorage.debug = false;
```
