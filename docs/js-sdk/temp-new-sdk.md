title: New JavaScript library
---

There is a new [JavaScript web library](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js/tree/main/packages/c2pa-web) for applications that run in a web browser environment.

We are working on adding documentation.  Please bear with us!

:::note
The old JavaScript client library is deprecated, but its documentation is still available in the [Legacy JavaScript library documentation](old-js-overview).  You can continue to use it, but it will no longer be updated or supported.
