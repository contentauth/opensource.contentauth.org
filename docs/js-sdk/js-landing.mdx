**Sept 2025**: The new JavaScript library, [c2pa-js](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js) has been released. You're encouraged to move to the new library as soon as possible.

:::note
The legacy JavaScript library has been moved to the [c2pa-js-legacy](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js-legacy) repository.

You can continue to install and use the old library, but it will no longer be updated or supported. The [Legacy JavaScript library documentation](../legacy-js-sdk/overview.mdx) is also still available for reference.
