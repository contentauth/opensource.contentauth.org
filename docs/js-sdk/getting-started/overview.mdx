Welcome to the [Content Authenticity Initiative](https://contentauthenticity.org/) JavaScript SDK. This library aims to make viewing and verifying [C2PA](https://c2pa.org/) data in the browser as easy as possible. Because it's a client JavaScript SDK, it performs only **read** operations on C2PA manifests, unlike the [Rust SDK](https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/rust-sdk/), which can both read and write manifests.

The SDK is a monorepo containing the following packages intended for client use:

- [**c2pa**](https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/js-sdk/api/c2pa) is the main package used for loading and verifying manifests. This package runs all of the processing
  logic on the client using a [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) module and exposes a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)-compatible API for easy integration.
- **c2pa-wc** provides UI components designed with input from the C2PA UX working group. It enables users to get up and running with standard UI patterns quickly and easily in any front-end environment.
- **@contentauth/react-hooks** provides a hooks interface for React components to quickly get manifest and thumbnail data in your React app.

To learn how to use these libraries, see the [Quick start](quick-start).

Additionally, the SDK includes the following supporting packages that are _not_ intended for separate use:

- **@cai/toolkit** contains the WebAssembly module, data binding functions, and related build tools. The `c2pa` package consumes this library under the hood. The WebAssembly module handles manifest parsing and validation.
- **@cai/detector** provides a high-performance binary scanner to quickly detect if C2PA manifest data exists in a file. The `c2pa` package also consumes this library.

## Features

### Developer friendly

The SDK makes integration easy, with full TypeScript support and robust debugging using the [debug](https://github.com/debug-js/debug) library.

### Performance

The processing code of this library uses a high-performance [WebAssembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly) binary. Additionally, the library offloads processing tasks to a configurable Web Worker pool to enable parallelization and avoid blocking a web application's main thread.

### Lazy loading and processing

Since images can be quite large, the library inspects the start of an asset file for C2PA manifest data before requesting the entire file, [if the server supports it](../guides/hosting#range-requests). The library will download the rest of the asset only if it finds the metadata marker. Additionally, it delays loading the WebAssembly binary until it makes the first processing request.

### Adherence to the C2PA specification

The SDK strives to maintain compliance with the [C2PA specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html) as much as possible, and the web components follow the [C2PA user experience guidance](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/ux/UX_Recommendations.html) recommendations.

### Security and encryption

The SDK handles all [validation](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_validation)
via the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) and passes any validation errors back to the client.

#### Supported signature algorithms

The JS SDK supports all ECDSA and RSASSA-PSS algorithms listed in the [C2PA specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_digital_signatures).

:::caution
Ed25519 signatures are currently **not** supported by the JS SDK.

### Framework-agnostic

The UI components are [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) that use the [Lit library](https://lit.dev/).
Because of this, you can use them in [React, Vue, Angular, Svelte](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/), or even vanilla JavaScript.
