Welcome to the [Content Authenticity Initiative](https://contentauthenticity.org/) JavaScript SDK. This library aims to make viewing and verifying [C2PA](https://c2pa.org/) data in the browser as easy as possible. Because it's a client JavaScript SDK, it performs only **read** operations on C2PA metadata, unlike the [Rust SDK](https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/rust-sdk/), which can both read and write C2PA manifest data.

The SDK is a monorepo containing the following packages intended for client use:

- [**c2pa**](https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/js-sdk/api/c2pa) is the main package used for loading and verifying C2PA data. This package runs all of the processing
  logic on the client using a [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) module and exposes a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)-compatible API for easy integration.
- **c2pa-wc** provides UI components designed with input from the C2PA UX working group. It is meant to
  enable users to get up and running with standard UI patterns quickly and easily in any front-end environment.
- **@contentauth/react-hooks** provides a hooks interface for React components to quickly get provenance and thumbnail data in your React app.

The above packages use the following supporting packages that are _not_ intended for separate use:

- **@cai/toolkit** houses the WebAssembly module, data binding functions, and related build tools. `c2pa` consumes
  this library under the hood. The WebAssembly module handles all parsing and validation.
- **@cai/detector** provides a high-performance binary scanner to quickly detect if C2PA metadata exists in a file.
  It is used to determine whether to download a file for further processing. This library is also brought in via `c2pa`.

To learn how to use these libraries, see the [Quick start](quick-start).

## Features

### Developer friendly

The SDK aims to make integration easy, with full TypeScript support and robust debugging using the [debug](https://github.com/debug-js/debug) library.

### Performance

The processing code of this library uses a high-performance [WebAssembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly) binary. Additionally, the library offloads processing tasks to a configurable web worker pool to enable parallelization and discourage blocking a web application's main thread.

### Lazy loading and processing

Since images can be quite large, the library inspects the start of a file for C2PA metadata before requesting the entire asset, [if the server supports it](../guides/hosting#range-requests). The library will download the rest of the image only if it finds the metadata marker. Additionally, it delays loading the WebAssembly binary until it makes the first processing request.

### Adherence to the C2PA specification

The SDK strives to maintain compliance with the [C2PA specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html) as much as possible, and the web components follow the [C2PA user experience guidance](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/ux/UX_Recommendations.html) recommendations.

### Security and encryption

The SDK handles all [validation](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_validation)
via the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) and passes any validation errors back to the client.

### Framework-agnostic

The UI components are [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) that use the [Lit library](https://lit.dev/).
Because of this, you can use them in [React, Vue, Angular, Svelte](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/), or even vanilla JavaScript.
