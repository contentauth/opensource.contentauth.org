## Terms

These definitions expand on the relevant terms in the [glossary](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_glossary)
found in the [C2PA 1.0 Technical Specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/index.html).

### C2PA Manifest

From [the specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_c2pa_manifest):

> The set of information about the provenance of an asset based on the combination of one or more assertions (including
> content bindings), a single _claim_, and a _claim signature_. A _C2PA Manifest_ is part of a _C2PA Manifest Store_.

This corresponds with the values of `manifestStore.manifests` returned by `c2pa.read()`.

### C2PA Manifest Store

From [the specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_c2pa_manifest_store):

> A collection of _C2PA Manifests_ that can either be embedded into an asset or be external to its _asset_.

This corresponds with the return value of `c2pa.read()`.

### Active Manifest

From [the specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_active_manifest):

> The last manifest in the list of _C2PA Manifests_ inside of a _C2PA Manifest Store_ which is the one with the set of _content bindings_ that are able to be validated.

This corresponds with the values of `manifestStore.activeManifest` returned by `c2pa.read()`.

### Asset

From [the specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_asset):

> A file or stream of data containing _digital content_, asset metadata and optionally, a _C2PA Manifest_.

This corresponds with the input passed as the main argument to `c2pa.read()`.

### Assertion

From [the specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_assertion):

> A data structure which represents a statement asserted by an _actor_ concerning the _asset_. This data is a part of the _C2PA Manifest_.

This corresponds with the values of `manifestStore.activeManifest.assertions.data` returned by `c2pa.read()`. This can contain
information such as:

- who produced the manifest
- ingredients used in the manifest
- any actions that were taken on the asset
- EXIF information
