## Prerequisites

### Node.js and Yarn

You must install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to run the examples.

#### macOS

1. **Install Homebrew:** The easiest way to install Node.js on your macOS system is by using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Follow the instructions on the Homebrew page to install it.
1. **Install Node.js:** Once you have installed Homebrew, open a terminal and enter this command:

```
brew install node@16
```

:::note
For more advanced JavaScript development, use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) rather than Homebrew to quickly install and use different versions of Node.js.

## Bringing in the library

### Using a CDN

The quickest way to get up and running is to use a content delivery network (CDN), such as [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/):

<Sandbox file="/examples/cdn/main.ts" displayType="preview" />

#### Static assets

One of the big advantages of using a CDN is that all of the required static assets are provided, so you do not have
to self-host them. They are also delivered at the edge, which enables faster downloads to your users. The static assets
include the following, as seen in the config passed to [`createC2pa`](../../js-sdk/api/c2pa.createc2pa):

```js
{
  wasmSrc: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/c2pa@${version}/dist/assets/wasm/toolkit_bg.wasm`,
  workerSrc: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/c2pa@${version}/dist/c2pa.worker.min.js`,
}
```

:::caution
Note the version numbers provided in the CDN URLs. These _must_ match in all of the places you reference the
library, so it is recommended that you reference a single variable that provides the version as shown in the example.
:::

### Package managers

You can also bring in our library with a package manager, such as `npm` or `yarn`. This way, all of the
client side code is hosted with your app and there are no external dependencies.

<Tabs>
   <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>

```bash
yarn add c2pa
```

  </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM" default>

```bash
npm install c2pa
```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pNPM">

```bash
pnpm install c2pa
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

#### Static assets

When loading via a package manager, the library needs access to two externally-hosted assets so it can "lazy load" them:

- `c2pa/dist/assets/wasm/toolkit_bg.wasm` - the WebAssembly binary
- `c2pa/dist/c2pa.worker.min.js` - the web worker script

:::note
Be sure to configure your server to send proper `Content-Type` headers for these files. For more information,
see [hosting](../guides/hosting).

Examples for common build systems are shown below. They are also available in the [`examples` directory](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js/tree/main/examples) in the SD repository.

export const ExampleLink = ({ example }) => {
  const linkText = `examples/${example}`;
  const link = `https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js/tree/main/${linkText}`;
  return (
    <div className="example-link">
      An example project is available here: <a href={link}>{linkText}</a>
    </div>
  );
};
