## Prerequisites

### Node.js and Yarn

You must install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to run the examples.

#### macOS

1. **Install Homebrew:** The easiest way to install Node.js on your macOS system is by using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Follow the instructions on the Homebrew page to install it.
1. **Install Node.js:** Once you have installed Homebrew, open a terminal and enter this command:

```
brew install node@16
```

:::note
For more advanced JavaScript development, use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) rather than Homebrew to quickly install and use different versions of Node.js.

## Using a CDN

The quickest way to get up and running is to use a content delivery network (CDN), such as [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/). One of the big advantages of using a CDN is that all of the required static assets are provided, so you do not have to host them. They are also delivered at the edge, which enables faster downloads to your users.

Static assets include the following, as seen in the config passed to [`createC2pa`](../../js-sdk/api/c2pa.createc2pa):

```js
{
  wasmSrc: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/c2pa@${version}/dist/assets/wasm/toolkit_bg.wasm`,
  workerSrc: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/c2pa@${version}/dist/c2pa.worker.min.js`,
}
```

:::caution
The version numbers provided in the CDN URLs _must_ match in all of the places you reference the
library. To make it easy, use a variable that provides the version as shown in the example.

<Sandbox file="/examples/cdn/main.ts" displayType="preview" />

## Using a package manager

You can also bring in the library with a package manager, such as `npm` or `yarn`. This way, all of the client side code is hosted with your app and there are no external dependencies.

   <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>

```bash
yarn add c2pa
```

  </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM" default>

```bash
npm install c2pa
```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pNPM">

```bash
pnpm install c2pa
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

#### Static assets

When loading via a package manager, the library needs access to two externally-hosted assets so it can "lazy load" them:

- `c2pa/dist/assets/wasm/toolkit_bg.wasm` - the WebAssembly binary
- `c2pa/dist/c2pa.worker.min.js` - the web worker script

:::note
Be sure to configure your server to send proper `Content-Type` headers for these files. For more information, see [Hosting](../guides/hosting).

Examples for common build systems are shown below. They are also available in the [`examples` directory](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js/tree/main/examples) in the SDK repository.

export const ExampleLink = ({ example }) => {
  const linkText = `examples/${example}`;
  const link = `https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js/tree/main/${linkText}`;
  return (
    <div className="example-link">
      An example project is available here: <a href={link}>{linkText}</a>
    </div>
  );
};
