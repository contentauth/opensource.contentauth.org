## Prerequisites

### Node.js & Yarn

You'll need both [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed to run the examples.

#### macOS

1. **Install Homebrew:** The easiest way to install Node.js on your macOS system is via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
   Please follow the instructions on their page to get this up and running.
1. **Install Node.js:** The quickest way to install Node.js is through Homebrew directly. Open up your terminal,
   enter `brew install node@16`, and press "return". _Note: For any more advanced JavaScript development, we recommend
   using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) rather than Homebrew to install Node.js._

## Bringing in the library

### Using a CDN

The quickest way to get up and running is to use a CDN, such as [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/):

<Sandbox file="/examples/cdn/main.ts" displayType="preview" />

#### Static assets

One of the big advantages with using a CDN is that all of the required static assets are provided, so you do not have
to self-host them. They are also delivered at the edge, which enables faster downloads to your users. The static assets
include the following, as seen in the config passed to [`createC2pa`](../../js-sdk/api/c2pa.createc2pa):

```js
{
  wasmSrc: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/c2pa@${version}/dist/assets/wasm/toolkit_bg.wasm`,
  workerSrc: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/c2pa@${version}/dist/c2pa.worker.min.js`,
}
```

:::caution
Please note the version numbers provided in the CDN URLs. These _must_ match in all of the places you reference the
library, so it is recommended that you reference a single variable that provides the version as shown in the example.
:::

### Package managers

You can also bring in our library with a package manager, such as `npm` or `yarn`. This way, all of the
client side code is hosted with your app and there are no external dependencies.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>
    <CodeBlock>yarn add c2pa</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">
    <CodeBlock>npm install c2pa</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pNPM">
    <CodeBlock>pnpm install c2pa</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Static assets

When loading via a package manager, the `c2pa` library needs access to two externally-hosted assets so that these can be
lazily loaded:

- `c2pa/dist/assets/wasm/toolkit_bg.wasm` - the WebAssembly binary
- `c2pa/dist/c2pa.worker.min.js` - the Web Worker script

:::note
Please be sure to configure your server to send proper `Content-Type` headers for these files. For more information,
please see our guide on [hosting](../guides/hosting).

Examples for common build systems are shown below. They are also available in the [`examples` directory](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js/tree/main/examples) in our repo.

export const ExampleLink = ({ example }) => {
  const linkText = `examples/${example}`;
  const link = `https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js/tree/main/${linkText}`;
  return (
    <div className="example-link">
      An example project is available here: <a href={link}>{linkText}</a>
    </div>
  );
};
