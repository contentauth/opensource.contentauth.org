## Prerequisites

You must install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for package management and TypeScript compilation.

#### macOS

To install Node.js on macOS:

1. **Install Homebrew:** The easiest way to install Node.js on your macOS system is by using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Follow the instructions on the Homebrew page to install it.
1. **Install Node.js:** Once you have installed Homebrew, open a terminal and enter this command:

```
brew install node@16
```

:::note
For more advanced JavaScript development, instead of Homebrew, use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to quickly install and use different versions of Node.js.

## Bringing in the SDK library

You can bring in the SDK library by using a content delivery network (CDN) or by hosting the files yourself.

### Using a CDN

The quickest way to get up and running is to use a CDN such as [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/). One of the big advantages of using a CDN is that it provides all the required static assets, so you don't have to host them. The CDN also delivers the files at the edge, which enables faster downloads to your users.

Static assets include the following, as seen in the config passed to [`createC2pa`](../../js-sdk/api/c2pa.createc2pa):

```js
{
  wasmSrc: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/c2pa@${version}/dist/assets/wasm/toolkit_bg.wasm`,
  workerSrc: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/c2pa@${version}/dist/c2pa.worker.min.js`,
}
```

:::caution
The version numbers provided in the CDN URLs _must_ match in all of the places you reference the
library. To make it easy, use a variable that provides the version as shown in the example.
:::

<Sandbox file="/examples/cdn/main.ts" displayType="preview" />

### Using a package manager

You can also bring in the library with a package manager, such as `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`. This way, all of the client side code is hosted with your app and there are no external dependencies. For example, using `npm`:

```bash
npm install c2pa
```

#### Static assets

When loading via a package manager, the library needs access to two externally-hosted assets so it can "lazy load" them:

- `c2pa/dist/assets/wasm/toolkit_bg.wasm` - the WebAssembly binary
- `c2pa/dist/c2pa.worker.min.js` - the Web Worker script

:::note
Be sure to configure your server to send proper `Content-Type` headers for these files. For more information, see [Hosting](../guides/hosting).

Examples for common build systems are shown below. They are also available in the [c2pa-js-examples repository](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js-examples).

export const ExampleLink = ({ example }) => {
  const linkText = `examples/${example}`;
  const link = `https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js/tree/main/${linkText}`;
  return (
    <div className="example-link">
      An example project is available here: <a href={link}>{linkText}</a>
    </div>
  );
};
