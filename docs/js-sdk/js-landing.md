**Sept 2025**: The new JavaScript library, [**c2pa-web**](../c2pa-js), has been released.  You're encouraged to move to the new library as soon as possible.

:::note
You can continue to [install and use the old library](getting-started/quick-start.mdx) the same as before, but it will no longer be updated or supported. Its documentation is still available in [Legacy JavaScript library documentation](js-sdk/getting-started/overview.mdx).
