A new JavaScript library has been released.  You can continue to [install and use the old library](getting-started/quick-start.mdx) the same was as before (for example, with `npm install c2pa`) but you're encouraged to move to the new library.  The old library will continue to be available [along with its documentation](getting-started/overview.mdx).
