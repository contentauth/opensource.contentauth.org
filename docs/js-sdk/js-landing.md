**Sept 2025**: A new JavaScript library has been released.  You can continue to use the old library, but you're encouraged to move to the new library as soon as possible.

:::note
You can continue to [install and use the old library](getting-started/quick-start.mdx) the same as before, but it will no longer be updated or supported. Its documentation is still available in [Legacy JavaScript library documentation](js-sdk/getting-started/overview.mdx).
