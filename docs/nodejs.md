**Sept 2025**: A new Node.js library has been released. You can continue to use the old library, but the old library is deprecated and you're encouraged to move to the new one as soon as possible.

:::note
You can continue to [install and use the old library](c2pa-node/readme.md) the same as before, but it will no longer be updated or supported.
