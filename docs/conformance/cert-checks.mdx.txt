## Checking your certificate

Before requesting to [add your signing certificate to the interim known certificate list](#how-to-add-a-certificate-to-the-list), perform a preliminary check to ensure the certificate is configured properly.

### Prerequisites

The preliminary certificate check procedure below requires the following tools. You must install them if you haven't done so already:

- [jq](https://jqlang.org/), a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. On macOS, if you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you can install jq by entering `brew install jq`.
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/), a cryptographic software library and CLI. It's installed on many systems such as macOS (but make sure you have a recent version). If OpenSSL is not installed on your system, see the [list of unofficial binary distributions](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries).
- [C2PA Tool](c2patool/readme.md), the command line tool for working with C2PA manifests and media assets.

### Procedure

:::note
In the example commands given below, `cert.pem` is your certificate file.
:::

Check your certificate by following these steps:

1. **Ensure that signing with the certificate doesn't have any validation errors** by using a C2PA Tool command like this:

   ```
   c2patool ./image.jpg trust --allowed_list ./cert.pem
   ```

   Confirm that the result does not contain a `validation_status` field, which indicates an error.

1. **Confirm that the `signature_info.issuer` field in the manifest is correct**. This field determines what [Verify displays for the organization name](verify.mdx#title-and-signing-information) after "Issued by ...". Use a C2PA Tool command like this:

   ```
   c2patool ./image.jpg trust --allowed_list ./cert.pem \
   | jq --args '.manifests[].signature_info.issuer'
   ```

   The response should be something like this:

   ```
   "XYZ Inc."
   ```

   Where "XYZ Inc." is the name of your organization.

1. **Use `openssl` to perform basic verification of the certificate** you're submitting; for example:

   ```
   openssl x509 -noout -text -in 'cert.pem' | grep 'Subject:'
   ```

   Example response:

   ```
   Subject: organizationIdentifier=XYZ-7155227, C=US, ST=Delaware, L=Dover, O=Whatever Inc., SN=xxx, GN=xxx, CN=xxx
   ```

## Using the interim known certificate list

You can use the C2PA Tool or the CAI JavaScript library to determine whether a certificate is on the interim known certificate list.

### Using with C2PA Tool

The [C2PA Tool documentation](c2patool/docs/usage.md#configuring-trust-support) explains how to use the interim known certificate list with the tool.

### Using with the JavaScript library

To load and use these lists with the JavaScript library (`c2pa-js`), pass them to the `read` function as shown in the following TypeScript example:

```ts
import { createC2pa, type ToolkitSettings } from 'c2pa';
import wasmSrc from 'c2pa/dist/assets/wasm/toolkit_bg.wasm?url';
import workerSrc from 'c2pa/dist/c2pa.worker.min.js?url';

async function loadTrustResource(file: string): Promise<string> {
  const res = await fetch(`https://contentcredentials.org/trust/${file}`);

  return res.text();
}

async function getToolkitSettings(): Promise<ToolkitSettings> {
  const [trustAnchors, allowedList, trustConfig] = await Promise.all(
    ['anchors.pem', 'allowed.sha256.txt', 'store.cfg'].map(loadTrustResource),
  );

  return {
    trust: {
      trustConfig,
      trustAnchors,
      allowedList,
    },
    verify: {
      verifyTrust: true,
    },
  };
}

async function readFile(asset: File) {
  const c2pa = await createC2pa({
    wasmSrc,
    workerSrc,
  });

  return c2pa.read(asset, {
    settings: await getToolkitSettings(),
  });
}
```

:::note
This code is for illustration purposes only. To ensure acceptable performance, production code should reuse the `c2pa` object and cache the output of `getToolkitSettings()` to avoid making unnecessary network calls.
:::

## How to add a certificate to the list

If you have an application that is in production and publicly available, you can request to add its signing certificate to the interim known certificate list.

:::warning Warning
The interim trust list is being deprecated. While you can still request to add your certificate to the list (through the end of 2025), you are strongly encouraged to apply to the C2PA conformance program and use the official C2PA trust list. See [C2PA conformance program](conformance/index.mdx) for more information.
:::

Follow these steps:

1. [**Do a preliminary check of your certificate**](#checking-your-certificate) to ensure it meets the requirements for C2PA signing certificates and to be in the Verify interim certificate list.
1. **Submit your request** by emailing `verify-tl@c2pa.org`. We will review your request, and if it is approved, we'll ask for more details. Once we receive them and deploy the update to the trust list, you will receive a confirmation email.
