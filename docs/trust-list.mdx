The C2PA **[Verify tool](https://contentcredentials.org/verify)** uses a list of _known certificates_ (sometimes referred to as a "trust list") to determine whether a Content Credential was issued by a known source. If an asset's Content Credential was not signed by a known certificate, the Verify tool will display this message:

<img
  src={verify_unknown_source}
  style={{ width: '300px', display: 'block', margin: '10px auto' }}
/>

Conversely, if the Content Credential was signed by a known certificate, the Verify tool will display the [name of the certificate owner and time of the claim signature](verify.mdx#title-and-signing-information).

:::note
The C2PA intends to publish an official public list of known certificates. Until then, **[Verify](https://contentcredentials.org/verify)** uses a temporary list. The list is subject to change and will be deprecated when C2PA publishes the official list.
:::

## Temporary known certificate list

The [contentcredentials.org](https://contentcredentials.org/) site hosts the following files that it uses to [validate signing certificates](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_c2pa_signers). Together, these files form the _temporary known certificate list_:

- **The temporary end-entity certificate list** in https://contentcredentials.org/trust/allowed.pem consists of end-entity certificates. If the certificate is on this list, it is considered "known." To reduce bandwidth consumption, a [version with SHA-256 hashes](https://contentcredentials.org/trust/allowed.sha256.txt) of the certificates is also available.
- **The temporary known anchor list** in https://contentcredentials.org/trust/anchors.pem contains the list of known anchor certificates. If an end-entity [certificate's chain](getting-started.mdx#signing-and-certificates) can be traced back to an anchor certificate on this list, the certificate is considered "known."
- **The configuration file**, https://contentcredentials.org/trust/store.cfg, specifies the [Extended Key Usage (EKU)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9336) values accepted for end-entity certificates. An end-entity certificate must have at least one of the EKUs in this list to be valid.

## Checking your certificate

Before requesting to [add your signing certificate to the known certificate list](#how-to-add-a-certificate-to-the-list), perform a preliminary check to ensure the certificate is configured properly.

### Prerequisites

The preliminary certificate check procedure below requires the following tools. You must install them if you haven't done so already:

- [jq](https://jqlang.org/), a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. On macOS, if you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you can install jq by entering `brew install jq`.
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/), a cryptographic software library and CLI. It's installed on many systems such as macOS (but make sure you have a recent version). If OpenSSL is not installed on your system, see the [list of unofficial binary distributions](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries).
- [C2PA Tool](c2patool/readme.md), the command line tool for working with C2PA manifests and media assets.

### Procedure

:::note
In the example commands given below, `cert.pem` is your certificate file.
:::

Check your certificate by following these steps:

1. **Ensure that signing with the certificate doesn't have any validation errors** by using a C2PA Tool command like this:

   ```
   c2patool ./image.jpg trust --allowed_list ./cert.pem
   ```

   Confirm that the result does not contain a `validation_status` field, which indicates an error.

1. **Confirm that the `signature_info.issuer` field in the manifest is correct**. This field determines what [Verify displays for the organization name](verify.mdx#title-and-signing-information) after "Issued by ...". Use a C2PA Tool command like this:

   ```
   c2patool ./image.jpg trust --allowed_list ./cert.pem \
   | jq --args '.manifests[].signature_info.issuer'
   ```

   The response should be something like this:

   ```
   "XYZ Inc."
   ```

   Where "XYZ Inc." is the name of your organization.

1. **Use `openssl` to perform basic verification of the certificate** you're submitting; for example:

   ```
   openssl x509 -noout -text -in 'cert.pem' | grep 'Subject:'
   ```

   Example response:

   ```
   Subject: organizationIdentifier=XYZ-7155227, C=US, ST=Delaware, L=Dover, O=Whatever Inc., SN=xxx, GN=xxx, CN=xxx
   ```

## Using the known certificate list

You can use the C2PA Tool or the CAI JavaScript library to determine whether a certificate is on the temporary known certificate list.

### Using with C2PA Tool

The [C2PA Tool documentation](c2patool/docs/usage.md#configuring-trust-support) explains how to use the temporary known certificate list with the tool.

### Using with the JavaScript library

To load and use these lists with the JavaScript library (`c2pa-js`), pass them to the `read` function as shown in the following TypeScript example:

```ts
import { createC2pa, type ToolkitSettings } from 'c2pa';
import wasmSrc from 'c2pa/dist/assets/wasm/toolkit_bg.wasm?url';
import workerSrc from 'c2pa/dist/c2pa.worker.min.js?url';

async function loadTrustResource(file: string): Promise<string> {
  const res = await fetch(`https://contentcredentials.org/trust/${file}`);

  return res.text();
}

async function getToolkitSettings(): Promise<ToolkitSettings> {
  const [trustAnchors, allowedList, trustConfig] = await Promise.all(
    ['anchors.pem', 'allowed.sha256.txt', 'store.cfg'].map(loadTrustResource),
  );

  return {
    trust: {
      trustConfig,
      trustAnchors,
      allowedList,
    },
    verify: {
      verifyTrust: true,
    },
  };
}

async function readFile(asset: File) {
  const c2pa = await createC2pa({
    wasmSrc,
    workerSrc,
  });

  return c2pa.read(asset, {
    settings: await getToolkitSettings(),
  });
}
```

:::note
This code is for illustration purposes only. To ensure acceptable performance, production code should reuse the `c2pa` object and cache the output of `getToolkitSettings()` to avoid making unnecessary network calls.
:::

## How to add a certificate to the list

If you have an application that is in production and publicly available, you can request to add its signing certificate to the temporary known certificate list.

Follow these steps:

1. [**Do a preliminary check of your certificate**](#checking-your-certificate) to ensure it meets the requirements for C2PA signing certificates and to be in the Verify temporary certificate list.
1. **Submit your request** by emailing `verify-tl@c2pa.org`. We will review your request, and if it is approved, we'll ask for more details. Once we receive them and deploy the update to the trust list, you will receive a confirmation email.
