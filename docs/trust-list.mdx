title: Verify tool trust list
---

The C2PA **[Verify tool](https://contentcredentials.org/verify)** uses a trust list of public keys to verify that a Content Credential was issued by a known source.

If an asset's Content Credential was not signed by a public key in the trust list, the Verify tool will display this message:

**This Content Credential was issued by an unknown source**.

:::note
The C2PA intends to publish an official C2PA public trust list. Until then, Verify uses a temporary known certificate list. The list is subject to change, and will be deprecated when the official trust list is published.

### Using the temporary known certificate list

The contentcredentials.org site hosts the following files that are used to [validate signing certificates](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_c2pa_signers):

- https://contentcredentials.org/trust/anchors.pem contains the certificates of the trust anchors.
- https://contentcredentials.org/trust/allowed.pem consists of trusted end-entity certificates that the site allows. To save bandwidth, a [version](https://contentcredentials.org/trust/allowed.sha256.txt) with the SHA-256 hashes of the certificates is also available.
- https://contentcredentials.org/trust/store.cfg contains the trust configuration. Currently this consists of accepted Extended Key Usage (EKU) values that the site supports.

#### Usage with c2patool

Please view the [c2patool documentation](https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/c2patool/#using-the-temporary-contentcredentialsorg--verify-trust-settings) which walks through how to use these resources with c2patool.

#### Usage with c2pa-js

You can load these lists into c2pa-js by passing them to the `read` or `readAll` functions as shown in the following example:

```ts
import { createC2pa, type ToolkitSettings } from 'c2pa';
import wasmSrc from 'c2pa/dist/assets/wasm/toolkit_bg.wasm?url';
import workerSrc from 'c2pa/dist/c2pa.worker.min.js?url';

async function loadTrustResource(file: string): Promise<string> {
  const res = await fetch(`https://contentcredentials.org/trust/${file}`);

  return res.text();
}

async function getToolkitSettings(): Promise<ToolkitSettings> {
  const [trustAnchors, allowedList, trustConfig] = await Promise.all(
    ['anchors.pem', 'allowed.sha256.txt', 'store.cfg'].map(loadTrustResource),
  );

  return {
    trust: {
      trustConfig,
      trustAnchors,
      allowedList,
    },
    verify: {
      verifyTrust: true,
    },
  };
}

async function readFile(asset: File) {
  const c2pa = await createC2pa({
    wasmSrc,
    workerSrc,
  });

  return c2pa.read(asset, {
    settings: await getToolkitSettings(),
  });
}
```

:::note
This code is for illustration purposes only. Production code should reuse the `c2pa` object and have a short-lived cache on the `getToolkitSettings()` output to avoid making unnecessary network calls.
