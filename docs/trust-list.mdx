The C2PA **[Verify tool](https://contentcredentials.org/verify)** uses a trust list of public keys to verify that a Content Credential was issued by a known source.

If an asset's Content Credential was not signed by a public key in the trust list, the Verify tool will display this message:

**This Content Credential was issued by an unknown source**.
