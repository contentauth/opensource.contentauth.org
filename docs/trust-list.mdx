import verify_unknown_source from '../static/img/verify-cc-unknown-source.png';

The C2PA **[Verify tool](https://contentcredentials.org/verify)** uses a list of _known certificates_ to determine that a Content Credential was issued by a known source. If an asset's Content Credential was not signed by a known certificate (as explained below), the Verify tool will display this message:

<img
  src={verify_unknown_source}
  style={{ width: '300px', display: 'block', margin: '10px auto' }}
/>

Conversely, if the Content Credential was signed by a known certificate, the Verify tool will display the [name of the certificate owner and time of the claim signature](verify#title-and-signing-information).

:::note
The C2PA intends to publish an official public list of known certificates. Until then, **[Verify](https://contentcredentials.org/verify)** uses a temporary list. The list is subject to change and will be deprecated when C2PA publishes the official list.

## Temporary known certificate list

The [contentcredentials.org](https://contentcredentials.org/) site hosts the following files that it uses to [validate signing certificates](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_c2pa_signers). Together, these files form the temporary known certificate list:

- **The temporary end-entity certificate list** in https://contentcredentials.org/trust/allowed.pem consists of end-entity certificates. If the certificate is on this list, it is considered "known." To reduce bandwidth consumption, a [version](https://contentcredentials.org/trust/allowed.sha256.txt) with the SHA-256 hashes of the certificates is also available.
- **The temporary known anchor list** in https://contentcredentials.org/trust/anchors.pem contains the list of known anchor certificates. If an end-entity [certificate's chain](getting-started#signing-and-certificates) can be traced back to an anchor certificate on this list, the certificate is considered "known."
- **The configuration file**, https://contentcredentials.org/trust/store.cfg, specifies the accepted Extended Key Usage (EKU) values that the site supports.

<div class="review-comment">
  Maurice: Does EKU filtering apply ONLY to anchor certs? Or also end-entity
  cert? (Eric--might be nice to have a loophole for accidental misconfig). Does
  this mean that only certs that have these EKUs are accepted?
</div>

## Using the known certificate list

You can use the C2PA Tool or the CAI JavaScript library to determine whether a certificate is on the temporary known certificate list.

### Using with C2PA Tool

The [C2PA Tool documentation](./c2patool/#using-the-temporary-contentcredentialsorg--verify-trust-settings) explains how to use the temporary known certificate list with the tool.

### Using with the JavaScript library

To load and use these lists with the JavaScript library (`c2pa-js`), pass them to the `read` function as shown in the following TypeScript example:

```ts
import { createC2pa, type ToolkitSettings } from 'c2pa';
import wasmSrc from 'c2pa/dist/assets/wasm/toolkit_bg.wasm?url';
import workerSrc from 'c2pa/dist/c2pa.worker.min.js?url';

async function loadTrustResource(file: string): Promise<string> {
  const res = await fetch(`https://contentcredentials.org/trust/${file}`);

  return res.text();
}

async function getToolkitSettings(): Promise<ToolkitSettings> {
  const [trustAnchors, allowedList, trustConfig] = await Promise.all(
    ['anchors.pem', 'allowed.sha256.txt', 'store.cfg'].map(loadTrustResource),
  );

  return {
    trust: {
      trustConfig,
      trustAnchors,
      allowedList,
    },
    verify: {
      verifyTrust: true,
    },
  };
}

async function readFile(asset: File) {
  const c2pa = await createC2pa({
    wasmSrc,
    workerSrc,
  });

  return c2pa.read(asset, {
    settings: await getToolkitSettings(),
  });
}
```

:::note
This code is for illustration purposes only. To ensure acceptable performance, production code should reuse the `c2pa` object and cache the output of `getToolkitSettings()` to avoid making unnecessary network calls.

## How to add a certificate to the known certificate list

If you have an application that is in production and publicly available, you can request adding the signing certificate to the temporary known certificate list.

To request adding a certificate to the list, email `tbd@contentcredentials.org` with the following information:

- Organization name.
- Type of certificate (root, intermediate, or end-entity).
- Certificate or certificate chain as a text file in PEM format (`.pem` or `.txt`).
- Sample image for testing.

We will review your request. If it is approved, it will be deployed to Verify and you will receive a confirmation email.

  We need to either create the email address or use the AirTable form:
