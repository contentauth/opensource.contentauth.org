The C2PA **[Verify tool](https://contentcredentials.org/verify)** uses a
_trust list_ of certificates to verify that a Content Credential was issued by a known source. If an asset's Content Credential was not signed by a "trusted certificate" (as explained below), the Verify tool will display this message:

<img
  src={verify_unknown_source}
  style={{ width: '300px', display: 'block', margin: '10px auto' }}
/>

Conversely, if the Content Credential was signed by a trusted certificate, the Verify tool will display the [name of the certificate owner and time of the claim signature](verify#title-and-signing-information).

:::note
The C2PA intends to publish an official public trust list. Until then, **[Verify](https://contentcredentials.org/verify)** uses a temporary trust list. The list is subject to change and will be deprecated when C2PA publishes the official trust list.

## Temporary trust list

The [contentcredentials.org](https://contentcredentials.org/) site hosts the following files that it uses to [validate signing certificates](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_c2pa_signers). Together, these files form the temporary trust list:

- **The temporary known certificate list** in https://contentcredentials.org/trust/allowed.pem consists of trusted end-entity certificates that the site allows. If the certificate is on this list, it is trusted. To reduce bandwidth consumption, a [version](https://contentcredentials.org/trust/allowed.sha256.txt) with the SHA-256 hashes of the certificates is also available.
- **The temporary known anchor list** in https://contentcredentials.org/trust/anchors.pem contains the certificates of the trust anchors. If an end-entity [certificate's chain](getting-started#signing-and-certificates) can be traced back to an anchor certificate on this list, the certificate is trusted.
- **The configuration file**, https://contentcredentials.org/trust/store.cfg, specifies the accepted Extended Key Usage (EKU) values that the site supports.

<div class="review-comment">
  Maurice: Does EKU filtering apply ONLY to known anchor list? Or also
  end-entity cert? (Eric--might be nice to have a loophole for accidental
  misconfig).

## Using the trust list

You can use the C2PA Tool or the CAI JavaScript library to determine whether a certificate is on the temporary trust list.

### Using with C2PA Tool

The [C2PA Tool documentation](./c2patool/#using-the-temporary-contentcredentialsorg--verify-trust-settings) explains how to use the temporary trust list with the tool.

### Using with the JavaScript library

To load and use these lists with the JavaScript library (`c2pa-js`), pass them to the `read` function as shown in the following TypeScript example:

```ts
import { createC2pa, type ToolkitSettings } from 'c2pa';
import wasmSrc from 'c2pa/dist/assets/wasm/toolkit_bg.wasm?url';
import workerSrc from 'c2pa/dist/c2pa.worker.min.js?url';

async function loadTrustResource(file: string): Promise<string> {
  const res = await fetch(`https://contentcredentials.org/trust/${file}`);

  return res.text();
}

async function getToolkitSettings(): Promise<ToolkitSettings> {
  const [trustAnchors, allowedList, trustConfig] = await Promise.all(
    ['anchors.pem', 'allowed.sha256.txt', 'store.cfg'].map(loadTrustResource),
  );

  return {
    trust: {
      trustConfig,
      trustAnchors,
      allowedList,
    },
    verify: {
      verifyTrust: true,
    },
  };
}

async function readFile(asset: File) {
  const c2pa = await createC2pa({
    wasmSrc,
    workerSrc,
  });

  return c2pa.read(asset, {
    settings: await getToolkitSettings(),
  });
}
```

:::note
This code is for illustration purposes only. To ensure acceptable performance, production code should reuse the `c2pa` object and cache the output of `getToolkitSettings()` to avoid making unnecessary network calls.
