title: C2PA conformance program
---

In mid-2025, C2PA launched its [conformance program](https://c2pa.org/conformance) and the transition to the official C2PA trust list. The [temporary (interim) trust list](trust-list.mdx) is being retired, since it was a temporary measure for early C2PA implementations.

The temporary trust list provided critical support during the early adoption phase of C2PA and enabled the C2PA Verify website to:

- Determine which certificates were valid.
- Prevent unknown signers from appearing as valid.

The new [C2PA trust list](https://github.com/c2pa-org/conformance-public/tree/main/trust-list), governed under the C2PA conformance program, introduces key enhancements:

- A new [public certificate policy](https://github.com/c2pa-org/conformance-public/blob/main/docs/current/C2PA%20Certificate%20Policy.pdf) that specifies C2PA requirements for certificate authorities (CAs).
- Higher security and interoperability.
- Stronger accountability and governance.
- Alignment with the C2PA 2.x technical specification.
- A robust governance framework.
