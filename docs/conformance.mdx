title: C2PA conformance program
---

The [C2PA conformance program](https://c2pa.org/conformance) was launched in mid-2025 to help ensure that products that read and create Content Credentials are compliant with the C2PA Content Credentials specification.

:::info
If you've developed a product that reads or creates Content Credentials, you can apply for it to be a _conforming product_ in the C2PA conformance program. If accepted, it is added to the [conforming products list](https://github.com/c2pa-org/conformance-public/blob/main/conforming-products/conforming-products-list.json#L302), which indicates it is compliant with the C2PA Content Credentials specification and can be used to validate and generate Content Credentials properly.

To start the process, fill out C2PA's [expression of interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScERZH5rKfoeSu3y6gGbkllkyeAhmF0G-kXS0eXpb2vR238Rg/viewform).

## Conformance program

The C2PA conformance program covers:

- _Validator products_ that read and validate Content Credentials.
- _Generator products_ that create Content Credentials and add them to a digital asset.
- Certificate authorities (CAs).

### Validator products

A _validator product_ can read and validate a manifest store for a digital asset.
A conforming validator product produces correct validation results according to the C2PA Content Credentials specification.

For more details, see [C2PA conformance program](https://github.com/c2pa-org/conformance-public/blob/main/docs/current/C2PA%20Conformance%20Program.pdf).

### Generator products

A _generator product_ can generate manifest data for a digital asset. A conforming generator product produces manifest data that conforms to the C2PA Content Credentials specification and creates assertions in the asset's active manifest and signs a claim using a valid X.509 certificate on the C2PA trust list.

A conforming generator product is accountable for producing correct manifests and claims that conform to the C2PA Content Credentials specification.

For more details, see [C2PA conformance program](https://github.com/c2pa-org/conformance-public/blob/main/docs/current/C2PA%20Conformance%20Program.pdf).

### Certificate authorities

The C2PA [certificate policy](https://github.com/c2pa-org/conformance-public/blob/main/docs/current/C2PA%20Certificate%20Policy.pdf) specifies requirements for certificate authorities (CAs) that issue claim signing certificates for use by generator products, and the requirements that those products have to meet when using the certificates.

CAs on the C2PA trust list can issue certificates to conforming generator products under the C2PA conformance program.

## C2PA trust lists

C2PA maintains two trust lists:

- [**C2PA trust list**](https://github.com/c2pa-org/conformance-public/blob/main/trust-list/C2PA-TRUST-LIST.pem): A list of X.509 certificate trust anchors (either root or subordinate certification authorities) that issue certificates to conforming generator products under the C2PA Certificate Policy.
- [**C2PA time-stamping authority (TSA) trust list**](https://github.com/c2pa-org/conformance-public/blob/main/trust-list/C2PA-TSA-TRUST-LIST.pem): A list of X.509 certificate trust anchors (either root or subordinate certification authorities) that issue time-stamp signing certificates to TSAs.

### Temporary trust list

With the introduction of the C2PA trust list, the existing [temporary (interim) trust list](trust-list.mdx) is being retired. It provided critical support during the early adoption phase of C2PA and enabled the [C2PA Verify website](https://contentcredentials.org/verify) to determine which certificates were valid and prevent unknown signers from appearing as valid.

### Timeline

**Through December 31, 2025**: The [temporary trust list](trust-list.mdx) will remain operational.

During this time:

- The Verify site will continue to display manifests signed by these certificates as trusted, but with a disclaimer that the manifests were made with an older version of the trust model.
- New certificates will continue to be added to the temporary trust list when requested.
- Product developers are strongly encouraged to apply to the C2PA conformance program and use the official C2PA trust list.

**January 1, 2026**: The temporary trust list will be frozen: No new entries will be added, and no updates will be made.

Starting then:

- Existing certificates will remain valid for legacy support.
- No future refreshes or additions will occur.

Eventually, the certificates on the temporary trust list will expire and will not be usable for signing. However, if content was signed during the temporary trust list certificate's validity period, the content will always be considered valid against the legacy trust model.

Validator products are encouraged to begin distinguishing between Content Credentials signed with certificates on the temporary trust list (typically tied to Content Credentials specification version version 1.4) and those from conforming products using the official C2PA trust list.
