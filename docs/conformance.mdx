title: C2PA conformance program
---

In mid-2025, C2PA launched its [conformance program](https://c2pa.org/conformance) for:

- Products that read and validate Content Credentials, referred to as _validator products_.
- Products that generate Content Credentials, referred to as _generator products_.
- Certificate authorities (CAs)

## Validator products

A _validator product_ can read and validate a manifest store for a digital asset.
A conforming validator product is accountable for producing correct validation results that conform to the C2PA Content Credentials specification.

For more details, see [C2PA conformance program](https://github.com/c2pa-org/conformance-public/blob/main/docs/current/C2PA%20Conformance%20Program.pdf).

## Generator products

A _generator product_ can generate a manifest store for a digital asset that conforms to the C2PA Content Credentials specification. A generator product creates assertions in the asset's active manifest and signs a claim using a valid X.509 certificate on the C2PA trust list.

A conforming generator product is accountable for producing correct manifests and claims that conform to the C2PA Content Credentials specification.

For more details, see [C2PA conformance program](https://github.com/c2pa-org/conformance-public/blob/main/docs/current/C2PA%20Conformance%20Program.pdf).

## Certificate authorities

The C2PA certificate policy sets requirements for a Certificate Authority (CA) that issues claim signing certificates to developers of generator products, and the requirements that those developers have to meet in the use of the certificates.

The policy requires that CAs only issue claim signing certificates to generator products that are on the conforming products list.

CAs that comply with the certificate policy and want to issue certificates under the C2PA conformance program must apply to the C2PA governing authority for inclusion on the
C2PA trust list.

## C2PA trust lists

The new [C2PA trust lists](https://github.com/c2pa-org/conformance-public/tree/main/trust-list), governed under the C2PA conformance program, introduces key enhancements:

- A new [public certificate policy](https://github.com/c2pa-org/conformance-public/blob/main/docs/current/C2PA%20Certificate%20Policy.pdf) that specifies C2PA requirements for certificate authorities (CAs).
- Higher security and interoperability.
- Stronger accountability and governance.
- Alignment with the C2PA 2.x technical specification.
- A robust governance framework.

C2PA maintains two trust lists:

- **C2PA trust list**: A list of X.509 certificate trust anchors (either root or subordinate certification authorities) that issue certificates to conforming generator products under the C2PA Certificate Policy.
- **C2PA time-stamping authority (TSA) trust list**: A list of X.509 certificate trust anchors (either root or subordinate certification authorities) that issue time-stamp signing certificates to TSAs.

### Interim trust list

With the introduction of the C2PA trust list, the existing [temporary (interim) trust list](trust-list.mdx) is being retired. It provided critical support during the early adoption phase of C2PA and enabled the [C2PA Verify website](https://contentcredentials.org/verify) to determine which certificates were valid and prevent unknown signers from appearing as valid.
