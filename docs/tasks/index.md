There are a number of common tasks when working with manifests. 
Although the tasks and APIs are similar at a high level, the way you accomplish each task is specific to the language being used.

- [Reading manifest data](./read.mdx)
- [Getting resources from a manifest](./get-resources.mdx)
- [Building a manifest](./build.mdx)
- [Writing a manifest](./write.mdx)
- [Signing a manifest](./sign.mdx)
