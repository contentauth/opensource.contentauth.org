There are a number of common tasks when working with manifests. 
The way you accomplish each task is specific to the language you're using, although at a high level the process is similar.

- [Preliminary setup](./setup.mdx)
- [Reading manifest data](./read.mdx)
- [Getting resources from a manifest](./get-resources.mdx)
- [Building a manifest](./build.mdx)
- [Writing a manifest](./write.mdx)
- [Signing a manifest](./sign.mdx)
