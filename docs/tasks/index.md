There are a number of common tasks when using the CAI open-source SDK. 
At a high level the process is the same in every language, but how you accomplish each task is specific to the language you're using.

- [Reading manifest data](./read.mdx)
- [Getting resources from a manifest](./get-resources.mdx)
- [Adding a manifest to an asset and signing it](./build.mdx)
