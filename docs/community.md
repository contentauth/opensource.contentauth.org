The Content Authenticity Initiative has an active and growing community of developers collaborating on the ecosystem of open-source tools and libraries for working with digital content provenance creation and validation.

## GitHub

All the open-source CAI code is hosted in GitHub in the [CAI GitHub organization](https://github.com/contentauth) and we welcome input in the form of issues and pull requests in the repositories:

- **Rust Library**: [c2pa-rs](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs)
- **CLI tool**: [c2patool](https://github.com/contentauth/c2patool)
- **JavaScript library**: [c2pa-js](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js)
- **Prerelease libraries**: 
  - [c2pa-python](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-python)
  - [c2pa-node](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-node)
  - [c2pa-c](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-c)
- **JavaScript examples**: [c2pa-js-examples](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js-examples)

If you think you've found a bug or want to request a feature, please open an issue in the appropriate repository.

We also welcome thoughtful pull requests (PRs) from the community, following the contribution guidelines provided out in each repository. The guidelines are generally the same for all the SDK repositories; for example. see the [c2pa-rs contribution guidelines](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Participants are required to follow the [Adobe Code of Conduct](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to maintain an open and welcoming environment for all.

### Incubator projects

These projects are in early alpha release:
- [iOS Library](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-ios): Provides iOS/macOS support via Swift Package/XCFramework.
- [Android Library](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-android): Provides native Android support via an AAR library.

Both of these projects wrap the C2PA Rust implementation ([c2pa-rs](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs)) using its C API bindings.

:::warning Warning
Incubator projects are still under active development and are not yet ready for general use.  However, input and bug reports are welcome in the GitHub repositories.
