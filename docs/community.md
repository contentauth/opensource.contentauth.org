The Content Authenticity Initiative has an active and growing community of developers collaborating on the ecosystem of open-source tools and SDKs for working with digital content provenance creation and validation.

## GitHub

All the open-source code is hosted in GitHub in the [CAI GitHub organization](https://github.com/contentauth) and we welcome input in the form of issues in the repositories:

- **Rust SDK**: [c2pa-rs](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs/issues)
- **CLI tool**: [c2patool](https://github.com/contentauth/c2patool/issues)
- **JavaScript SDK**: [c2pa-js](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js/issues)
- **JavaScript examples**: [c2pa-js-examples](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js-examples)

If you think you've found a bug or want to request a feature, please open an issue in the appropriate repository.

We also welcome thoughtful pull requests (PRs) from the community, following the contribution guidelines provided out in each repository. The guidelines are generally the same for each of the three project repositories; for example. see the [c2pa-rs contribution guidelines](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Participants are required to follow the [Adobe Code of Conduct](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to maintain an open and welcoming environment for all.
