title: Configuring and using a signing certificate in production
---

## Overview

For convenience, C2PA Tool, the Rust library, and the CAI prerelease libraries include one or more [test certificates](manifest/signing-manifests#test-certificates) and private keys for use during development, typically in the `tests/fixtures` directory.

While these test certificates and keys are useful during development and testing, for production deployment you must use your own private key and purchase and configure your own certificate, as explained in [Getting a security certificate](getting-started#getting-a-security-certificate).

Certificates and private keys are often stored on a hardware security module (HSM), a physical device that attaches directly to a computer or server and is used to securely manage and perform operations on cryptographic keys.

  How does using Amazon KMS compare to an HSM? Should we recommend KMS? Can we
  provide any guidance here?

## The Python example

The [c2pa-python-example](/c2pa-python-example) app provides an example of constructing a certificate signing request to help you get started.
