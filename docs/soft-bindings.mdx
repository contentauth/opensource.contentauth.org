Durable Content Credentials is a concept that allows for the use of a variety of watermarking and fingerprinting approaches.

As described in the C2PA specification, a [soft binding](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_soft_bindings) such as an invisible watermark or content fingerprint provides a mechanism to recover an asset's manifest if the metadata containing the manifest has been stripped. The soft binding is used to look up the manifest within a manifest repository. The soft binding is described by the [soft binding assertion](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_soft_bindings).

The information below is from [C2PA's authoritative list of soft binding algorithms](https://github.com/c2pa-org/softbinding-algorithm-list).
