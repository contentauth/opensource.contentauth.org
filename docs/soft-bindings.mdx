[_Durable Content Credentials_](https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/durable-content-credentials) is a concept that combines C2PA secure metadata, undetectable watermarks, and content fingerprinting to make content provenance more robust than using just one of these methods.

In the C2PA specification, watermarks and content fingerprinting are known as [soft bindings](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_soft_bindings), which enable digital content to be matched even if the underlying bits differ. For example, if manifest metadata has been stripped from an asset, then you can use a soft binding to look up and recover the manifest from an online repository.

The C2PA specification requires that soft bindings be generated using one of the [soft binding algorithms](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_soft_binding_algorithm_list) approved by the C2PA Technical Working Group. The following table lists the algorithms from the [C2PA Soft Binding Algorithm List](https://github.com/c2pa-org/softbinding-algorithm-list).
