[Durable Content Credentials](https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/durable-content-credentials) combines Content Credentials secure metadata, undetectable watermarks, and content fingerprinting to make content provenance more robust than using just one of these methods.

As described in the C2PA specification, if the metadata a manifest has been stripped from an asset, then you can use a [soft binding](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_soft_bindings) such as an invisible watermark or fingerprint to look up the manifest within a repository so it can be recovered.

The C2PA specification doesn't cover watermarking and fingerprinting techniques _per se_, rather it allows using a variety of approaches. The following table lists the algorithms approved by the C2PA Technical Working Group from the [C2PA Soft Binding Algorithm List](https://github.com/c2pa-org/softbinding-algorithm-list).
