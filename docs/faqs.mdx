### Is CAI a blockchain system?

<FaqAnswer>

While the CAI is compatible with blockchain, CAI-enabled features do not require or use blockchain directly.

Examples:

- [Starling Lab case study](https://www.starlinglab.org/78days/) that uses blockchain for distributed storage.
- [Numbers Protocol](https://www.numbersprotocol.io/) is also using blockchain to store Content Credentials; See [Numbers Blockchain](https://docs.numbersprotocol.io/developers/numbers-blockchain).

</FaqAnswer>

### Is the CAI about digital rights management?

<FaqAnswer>

No; CAI does not enforce permissions for access to content. In many cases, the name displayed on the [Verify website](https://contentcredentials.org/verify) is the name of the exporter of the content, not the rights owner.

The [“Produced by” section](verify#produced-by) in Verify refers to the name of the exporter. If the image was created with an Adobe Product such as Photoshop with Content Credentials (Beta) enabled, the “Produced by” section shows the name of the Adobe ID associated with the user who exported the image.

### Do Content Credentials indicate if an image is fake or altered?

<FaqAnswer>

Content Credentials don't indicate if an image is fake or altered. They can provide information on the origin of an image and how it was edited. For example, if an AI tool supports Content Credentials, then they indicate if [an image was generated with AI](manifest/assertions-actions#generative-ai-action). If an image was taken with a C2PA-enabled camera, the Content Credentials would show that, along with any subsequent edits, if they were made with C2PA-enabled software tools.

:::info
Content Credentials provide a **positive signal** about the origin and history of an image, but they don't provide a **negative signal** about the authenticity of an image.
:::

An image with Content Credentials is like box of cereal with a nutrition label that tells you what's in it; on the other hand, an image with no Content Credentials is like a box of cerreal without any nutrition information, so you don't know what's in it or where it came from. Because the Content Credentials are cryptographically signed, you can trust the information they provide and detect if they've been tampered with.

</FaqAnswer>

### What happens if someone takes a photo or screenshot of an existing image?

<FaqAnswer>

Content Credentials don't prevent anyone from taking a screenshot or photo of an image, but they indicate when a file does not have historical data. A screenshot of an image wouldn't include C2PA metadata from the original image.

Conversely, if you use a C2PA-enabled camera to take a photo of an image, the camera will sign the image, but since it has no way of detecting what it is, the Content Credentials won't reflect that. For example, if the original image was generated with AI, the camera won't flag it as such. In general, the camera will indicate the device, when and where the image was taken in metadata, but it is not capable of analyzing the content of the image.

</FaqAnswer>

### What information is embedded in Content Credentials?

<FaqAnswer>

The information embedded in Content Credentials is totally up to each implementor.
The [manifest](manifest/understanding-manifest) that defines the Content Credentials
can include various assertions about the image, including the ingredients, the
date and time, the location, and the device that created the image.

</FaqAnswer>

### How can I prove time and place an image was created without revealing my identity?

<FaqAnswer>

Content Credentials can specify identity by using the [Schema.org CreativeWork assertion](manifest/assertions-actions#creative-work-assertion), but it is _entirely optional_.

For example, using Photoshop you
can add Content Credentials that indicate what edits were made without saying who
did it. You would know Adobe signed the Content Credentials and that's it. Regardless
of the "who", the cryptographically-signed manifest ensures you know the date and
time. A camera could also include Exif metadata with location information.

</FaqAnswer>

### How do you prevent faking GPS location metadata?

<FaqAnswer>

The location data included in [Exif metadata](manifest/assertions-actions#exif-assertion) is based on the implementor. People would trust the data based on the various "trust signals" they are given in the manifest, such as who signed it and when.
