## Overview

There are numerous options for generating docs from JSON schema.  [json-schema.org](https://json-schema.org/implementations.html#documentation-generators) lists several.

I looked at these:

- [Docusaurus plugin](https://jy95.github.io/docusaurus-json-schema-plugin/): See below
- [adobe/jsonschema2md](https://github.com/adobe/jsonschema2md/tree/main) but it seems to fail on the generated manifest.
- We might be able to use [json-schema-static-docs](https://tomcollins.github.io/json-schema-static-docs/) but I need a bit of guidance on embedding it in a Docusaurus page.
- Atlassian has an online viewer at <https://json-schema.app/start>. Can view [output for the generated schema](https://json-schema.app/view/%23?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fcrandmck%2Ftest-md%2Fmaster%2FManifestStore.schema.json) using a raw GH file.

## Docusaurus plugin

This is the output from the [Docusaurus JSON schema plugin](https://jy95.github.io/docusaurus-json-schema-plugin/).  Seems to be recently updated: <https://github.com/jy95/docusaurus-json-schema-plugin>.

The styling could use a bit of work to make it more obvious when you can expand something (e.g. an object).

This is the reference generated from the manifest JSON schema.

<JSONSchemaViewer schema={Schema} />

<CodeBlock language="json">{JSON.stringify(Schema, null, 2)}</CodeBlock>
