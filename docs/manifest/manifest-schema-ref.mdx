## Overview

We will provide a reference generated from the manifest JSON schema (which is generated from the source code).

TO DO:

- Review the schema and decide what needs to be "redacted" or just not documented.
- Decide the tool to use to generate the reference doc.

There are numerous options for generating docs from JSON schema. [json-schema.org](https://json-schema.org/implementations.html#documentation-generators) lists several. I looked at these:

- [Docusaurus plugin](https://jy95.github.io/docusaurus-json-schema-plugin/): See below
- [adobe/jsonschema2md](https://github.com/adobe/jsonschema2md/tree/main) but it seems to fail on the generated manifest.
- We might be able to use [json-schema-static-docs](https://tomcollins.github.io/json-schema-static-docs/) but I need a bit of guidance on embedding it in a Docusaurus page.

Possibly useful tool for us, but not something we could use to generate doc: Atlassian has an online viewer at <https://json-schema.app/start>. Can view [output for the generated schema](https://json-schema.app/view/%23?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fcrandmck%2Ftest-md%2Fmaster%2FManifestStore.schema.json) using a raw GH file.

## Docusaurus plugin

This is the output from the [Docusaurus JSON schema plugin](https://jy95.github.io/docusaurus-json-schema-plugin/). Repo seems to be recently updated: <https://github.com/jy95/docusaurus-json-schema-plugin>.

The styling could use a bit of work to make it more obvious when you can expand something (e.g. an object).

<JSONSchemaViewer schema={Schema} />

# Source

<CodeBlock language="json">{JSON.stringify(Schema, null, 2)}</CodeBlock>
