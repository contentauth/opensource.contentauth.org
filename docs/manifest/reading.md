title: Reading and validating manifest data
---

Use a [Reader](json-ref/reader.mdx) structure when reading and validating manifest data. The Rust library and other language libraries provide methods and objects for working with this structure.
This JSON reference is generated from the JSON schema for [Reader](https://docs.rs/c2pa/latest/c2pa/struct.Reader.html) objects (_struct_ in Rust terminology).
