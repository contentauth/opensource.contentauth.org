title: Building and writing manifest data
---

Use a [ManifestDefinition](json-ref/manifest-def.mdx) structure to define and construct manifest data for writing. The Rust library and other language libraries provide methods and objects for working with this structure.  This JSON reference is generated from the JSON schema for [ManifestDefinition](https://docs.rs/c2pa/latest/c2pa/struct.ManifestDefinition.html) object (_struct_ in Rust terminology).
