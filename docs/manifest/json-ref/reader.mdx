:::danger Warning
This is a beta release of this reference. It is a work in progress and may not be accurate or complete. It was generated from the unmodified JSON schema generated from c2pa-rs on 05/09/2025.

The [C2PA specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_manifests) describes a manifest with a binary structure in JPEG universal metadata box format ([JUMBF](https://www.iso.org/standard/84635.html)) that includes JSON as well as binary data for things like encryption keys and thumbnail images. Because the binary structure is hard to understand and program to, the SDK defines a JSON manifest structure that's a declarative language for representing and creating a binary manifest.

The JSON manifest is an abstract translation layer that's easier to understand than the binary format. It can describe everything in the underlying binary format except for binary data such as thumbnails that are included by a structure called a _resource reference_. To generate a binary manifest, the SDK assembles all the JSON objects, resource references, and ingredients defined, and then converts them into different assertions and other objects as required.
