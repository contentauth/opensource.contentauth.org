_Need to make sure these examples cover the main use cases that will have different kinds of manifests._

## Examples from c2patool

### Simple manifest

This manifest was saved using `c2patool` with no options.

import SimpleManifestEx from '!!raw-loader!./simple-manifest-ex.json.jsx';

<CodeBlock language="json" showLineNumbers>
  {SimpleManifestEx}
</CodeBlock>

### Detailed manifest

import DetailedManifestEx from '!!raw-loader!./detailed-manifest-ex.json.jsx';

This manifest was saved using `c2patool` with the `-d` option. Even though it was generated for the same asset and Content Credentials as the simple manifest example, you can see that it's about twice as long.

<CodeBlock language="json" showLineNumbers>
  {DetailedManifestEx}
</CodeBlock>
