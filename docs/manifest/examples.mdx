## Examples from c2patool

<!--
Need to make sure these examples cover the main use cases that will have different kinds of manifests.
-->

The command-line tool [`c2patool`](/docs/c2patool) is helpful when developing applications to work with manifest data. When saving a manifest, it has two modes:

- **Standard mode** (the default), where it saves a manifest file in JSON format, which is simplified and slightly different from the underlying binary manifest structure.
- **Detailed mode** (specified with the `-d` option), where it saves a file that more closely reflects the actual structure of the binary data, including assertions with JUMBF URLs and their associated hashes.

### Simple manifest

This manifest was saved using `c2patool` with no options.

import SimpleManifestEx from '!!raw-loader!./simple-manifest-ex.json.jsx';

<CodeBlock language="json" showLineNumbers>
  {SimpleManifestEx}
</CodeBlock>

### Detailed manifest

import DetailedManifestEx from '!!raw-loader!./detailed-manifest-ex.json.jsx';

This manifest was saved using `c2patool` with the `-d` option. Even though it was generated for the same asset and Content Credentials as the simple manifest example, you can see that it's about twice as long.

<CodeBlock language="json" showLineNumbers>
  {DetailedManifestEx}
</CodeBlock>
