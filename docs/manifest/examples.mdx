import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

We should provide a few good examples. What are the main use cases that will have different kinds of manifests?

Can we move <https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/c2patool/#example-manifest-definition-file> here?

## Examples from c2patool

### Simple manifest

This manifest was saved using `c2patool` with no options.

import SimpleManifestEx from '!!raw-loader!./simple-manifest-ex.json.jsx';

<CodeBlock language="json" showLineNumbers>{SimpleManifestEx}</CodeBlock>

### Detailed manifest

import DetailedManifestEx from '!!raw-loader!./detailed-manifest-ex.json.jsx';

This manifest was saved using `c2patool` with the `-d` option.  Even though it was generated for the same asset and Content Credentials as the simple manifest example, you can see that it's about twice as long.

<CodeBlock language="json" showLineNumbers>{DetailedManifestEx}</CodeBlock>
