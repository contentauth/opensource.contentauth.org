title: Building and writing manifest data
---

Use a [ManifestDefinition](../json-ref/manifest-def.mdx) structure to define and construct manifest data for writing. The Rust library and other language libraries provide methods and objects for working with this structure.  

- [Writing ingredients](ingredients.md)
- [Writing assertions and actions](assertions-actions.md)
- [ManifestDefinition JSON reference](manifest/json-ref/manifest-def.mdx) generated from the JSON schema for the [ManifestDefinition](https://docs.rs/c2pa/latest/c2pa/struct.ManifestDefinition.html) object (_struct_ in Rust terminology).
