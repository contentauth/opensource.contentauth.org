title: Open-source SDK task planning and roadmap

import TOCInline from '@theme/TOCInline';

<TOCInline toc={toc} />

This is an overview of task planning for the CAI open-source SDK to provide a general idea of priorities and progress. The roadmap is subject to change based on feedback and other factors.

:::note
This information was updated in **May 2024**. It will be regularly updated but may not always reflect the most current status.
:::

Tasks are categorized as follows:

- [**Done**](#done): Tasks that are completed to some degree. Depending on the status, they may not yet be in a release.
  - [**Released**](#released): The task has been coded, checked in, and in a repo (SDK library) tagged release.
  - [**Merged to Main**](#merged-to-main): Code has been merged to the main branch but not yet released.
  - [**Code Complete**](#code-complete): Coding is done, but testing may still be in progress, and the task has not been merged to the main branch.
- [**Underway**](#underway): Tasks in progress or planning.
  - [**In Progress**](#in-progress): Work is in progress.
  - [**To Do**](#todo): Planned for future work.
  - [**In Review / Triage**](#in-review--triage): Task is under review to determine if and when it can be addressed.

A new issue/task starts in the **In Review / Triage** status. Once reviewed and approved, it moves into **To Do** status, and when a developer begins working on it, into **In Progress**. Once development work is done, the task moves to **Code Complete**. After testing and validation, it moves to **Merged to Main** and finally&mdash;when the code is put into a release&mdash; to **Released**.
