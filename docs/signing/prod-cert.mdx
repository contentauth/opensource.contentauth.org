title: Using a signing certificate in production
---

Accessing a private key and certificate [directly from the local file system](local-signing.md) is fine during development, but doing so in production is not secure. Instead use one or both of:

- **A key management service** (KMS), a system used to securely store and manage cryptographic keys, including generation, storage, rotation, and revocation.
- **A hardware security module** (HSM), a physical device that attaches directly to a server to securely manage and perform operations on cryptographic keys.

:::warning
Best practices for handling keys and certificates are beyond the scope of this documentation. Always protect your private keys with the highest level of security; for example, never share them through insecure channels such as email.

Some useful references for handling keys and certificates include:

- [Key Management Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Key_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#storage) from the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP).
- [Key Management Guidelines](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Key-Management/Key-Management-Guidelines) from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, US Department of Commerce.
- [Protect your private keys](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/in-house-public-key-infrastructure/pki-principles/protect-your-private-keys) from the UK National Cyber Security Centre.

## The C2PA Python example

The [c2pa-python-example](c2pa-python-example/readme.md) app provides an example of constructing a certificate signing request (CSR) and of using [Amazon KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/).
