## What happens if I use a C2PA-enabled camera to take a photo of an AI-generated image? 

The camera will sign the image, but since it has no way of detecting what it is, it wonâ€™t flag it as generated with AI.  In general, the camera will indicate the device, when and where the image was taken in metadata, but it is not capable of analyzing the content of the image.

## What happens If I take a screenshot of an image with Content Credentials?

Screenshots kind of relate to the above (picture of a picture). At Adobe there are  cloud solutions that add resiliency. Nothing is 100%, but there are ways to find your ways back to the original manifest, even with edits.

## What information is embedded in the jpg? Is it every change or is it just a hash to each ingredient?
The information embedded is totally up to each implementor. The docs are better to explain the kinds of things that can go in.

## What is the normal dataflow? The flow when you make a new image? The flow when you take a photo? The flow when you alter the image? A diagram with boxes and arrows would be helpful.

I don't know if there is a "normal" flow as the standard is still so new compared to the speed of most standard organizations. However if you have an asset with C2PA and make modifications, an app should use the original as an ingredient and continue recording more details.

## Privacy: Assume I need to prove a crime took place and I will get killed if they find out I took the picture. How can I prove time, place and content without revealing my identity?

Identity is an optional piece in any Content Credential. For example, if you use Photoshop you can easily sign what was done (if any edits at all) without saying who did it. You would know Adobe was the signer and that was it. Regardless of the who, the cryptography ensures we know the date time.

## Assume I can setup my own GPS senders (think software defined radio), will I be able to fake the location? Or is location coming from something different?

The data is based on the implementor. People would trust the data based on the various "trust signals" they are given in the manifest, ie who signed it and when.
