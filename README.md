[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c2fe0e49-4596-48e8-8e1a-9cf62d56bca2/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/contentauth/deploys)

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator, and deployed
on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Installation

```
$ npm
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Deployments are handled automatically by Netlify. Please open up a pull request with any changes and a preview site
should be created automatically so that the preview can be shared before merging.

Any changes in `main` will automatically be deployed to https://contentauth.netlify.app/ (password is `oss stage`).
